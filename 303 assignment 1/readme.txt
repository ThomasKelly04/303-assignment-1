The program expects an input data file named data.txt to be present in the same directory. 
Ensure that this file contains 10 lines, each with 10 integers separated by spaces. Example:
4 2 1 4 5 0 7 8 6 8

findInteger(num): Finds the index of a specific integer in the array.
modifyInteger(index, newValue): Modifies the value of an integer at a given index and returns the old and new values.
addInteger(num): Adds a new integer to the end of the array.
replaceOrRemove(index, remove): Replaces a value with either 0 or removes the integer altogether.
printArray(): Prints the modified array.

The program includes error handling to catch and display exceptions. If any errors occur, error messages will be printed to the console.
